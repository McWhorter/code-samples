# Welcome to Jason McWhorter's code samples and website portfolio

## Website Portfolio

I was responsibile for the complete buildout of all structure, styling, and functionality implemented within each site listed below.

- [Alameda County Employees’ Retirement Association](https://www.acera.org/)
- [Old Sacramento Waterfront](https://www.oldsacramento.com/)
- [New York City Employees’ Retirement System](https://www.nycers.org/)

## Code Samples

Below are small descriptions of each directory contained within this repository. Each give a glimpse into the work you can expect from me and my typical organization of code, documenation of logic, and overall structure for which I use. Enjoy!

### Adaptable Navigation Menu

*`./Naviation`*

This navigation menu serves as both a vertical or horizontal orientation. It has other features which allow the visibility of submenus based on either hover or click interaction.

This menu is also powered by a breakpoint configuration to aid when it should be in touch or hover state depending on the viewport width.

There are many more options to tinker with. Take a look under the hood at the `Navigation.js` component's documentation.

### Carousel Component

*`./Carousel`*

A versatile slider/carousel powered by the Flickity NPM library.

I've created a custom play/pause control to aid WCAG 2.1 AA complience to autoscrolling content.

The component also has a SVG/CSS powered progress loop to indicate the time left before transitioning to the next slide.

### Accessibility Complient Panel Group Component

*`./PanelGroup`*

This component creates a toggle state to show/hide content based on user click interaction. It is useful to keep content organized and compact and is commonly a dropdown or accordion section.

### Coding Style and Structure Example

*`./StyleStructure`*

This is an example of my typical directory structure, code style, and code standards.
